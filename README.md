# Overview
In this competition, participants will build machine learning models to predict the price of Russian car plates based on historical sale offer data (2021 – 2025), accounting for price changes over time.

# Description
In Russia, vehicle registration plates (commonly called “numbers”) consist of three letters (from 'ABEKMHOPCTYX'), three digits (except '000'), and a region code. Our dataset contains car plate sale offers collected from various sources, including aggregators, Telegram channels, and websites. Since the same plate may have been listed multiple times at different prices, we recorded all observed price changes over time. Some plates are affiliated with government agencies or have symbolic meanings, making them significantly more valuable (more on that in the "Data" page). Participants may want to consider these factors when building their models.

We have developed our own model and deployed it as a Telegram bot: AI оценка номера авто.
